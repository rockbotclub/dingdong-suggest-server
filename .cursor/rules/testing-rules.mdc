## 5. Testing Approaches

### 5.1. Unit Testing

- **Test Individual Components:** Unit tests should focus on testing individual components (e.g., page objects, utilities) in isolation.
- **Mock External Dependencies:** Mock external dependencies (e.g., WebDriver, APIs) to isolate the component being tested.
- **Assert Expected Behavior:** Use assertions to verify that the component behaves as expected.
- **Test Edge Cases:** Test edge cases and error conditions to ensure that the component is robust.

### 5.2. Integration Testing

- **Test Interactions Between Components:** Integration tests should focus on testing the interactions between different components.
- **Use Real Dependencies:** Use real dependencies (e.g., WebDriver) to test the component's behavior in a realistic environment.
- **Verify System Behavior:** Verify that the system as a whole behaves as expected.

### 5.3. End-to-End Testing

- **Test Complete Workflows:** End-to-end tests should focus on testing complete workflows from start to finish.
- **Simulate User Interactions:** Simulate user interactions to test the system's behavior in a realistic scenario.
- **Verify Business Requirements:** Verify that the system meets the business requirements.

### 5.4. Test Organization

- **Separate Test Files:** Create separate test files for each component or feature.
- **Use Descriptive Names:** Use descriptive names for test files and test functions.
- **Group Tests:** Group related tests into test suites or test classes.
- **Use Test Fixtures:** Use test fixtures to set up and tear down test environments consistently.

### 5.5. Mocking and Stubbing

- **Mock WebDriver:** Mock the WebDriver instance to isolate components from the browser.
- **Stub API Responses:** Stub API responses to test the component's behavior with different data.
- **Verify Method Calls:** Verify that methods are called with the expected arguments.
